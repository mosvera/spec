# Example: Cinematic Editorial

A worked Mosvera aesthetic system expressed entirely in schema-valid documents.
It demonstrates single inheritance (`noir` extends `cinematic-editorial-base`),
modifier composition (`golden-hour`, `high-contrast`), an inline override, and a
project-level `merge-strategies.json` declaring that the open aesthetic field
`lights` merges by the `name` key (MEP-0001 `merge_by`). The composition also
includes the Phase 4 image-generation fields (`subject`, `aspect_ratio`,
`quality`, `safety`, and `palette.accent`) used by the provider adapters.

`manifests/illustrative-image.manifest.json` is an **illustrative** capability
manifest used only to exercise the MEP-0003 compilation contract end-to-end. It
is NOT a real provider adapter. The real reference adapters live under
`providers/`.

This directory is the default registry for the reference MCP server
(`npm --workspace @mosvera/mcp start`).
